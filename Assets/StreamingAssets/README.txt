Hey! This folder is necessary for FMOD. Its contents (except this file) are gitignored.

FMOD moves assets from the project source (/FMOD in the root folder) to this folder (Assets/StreamingAssets) so that Unity can read them. As such, please don't delete this folder, even if it looks empty. Thank you!
